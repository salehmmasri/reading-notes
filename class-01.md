#### Structuring word documents
**The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information**

**This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down on the page. When using a word processor to create a document, we separate out the text to give it structure. Each topic might have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to describe what it covers**

**On the right, you can see a simple document in Microsoft Word. The different styles for the document, such as different levels of heading, are shown in the drop down box. If you regularly use Word, you might have also used the formatting toolbar or palette to do this.**

#### extra markup
**At this point, we have covered the main tags that fit nicely into groups and sections. In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are not easily grouped together. You will learn about:**

- The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version you are using

- How to add comments to your code

- Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element, including the class and id attributes

- Elements that are used to group together parts of the page where no other element is suitable

- How to embed a page within a page using iframes

- How to add information about the web page using the element

- Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright symbols

##### the Evolution of html

- html 4

- xhtml 1.0

- html5

##### doctypes
Because *there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the *book.

##### HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of X different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

- The new elements provide clearer code (compared X with using multiple elements).

- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 X elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 X (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

##### Process & Design

- It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
