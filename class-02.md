### TEXT
___

**When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.**

- Structural markup:the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs

- Semantic markup:which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on

# This is a Main Heading
## This is a Level 2 Heading
### This is a Level 3 Heading
#### This is a Level 4 Heading
##### This is a Level 5 Heading
###### This is a Level 6 Heading

***paragraph***

*To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening tag and closing tag.*

***A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.***


*Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of text. For example, a book may have chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under each heading there will be one or more paragraphs.</p>*

### INTRODUCING CSS
**CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface**
**CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.**

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your X rules at different elements.

- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, X although they may appear within an HTML page.

### Basic JavaScript Instructions
 **A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.**
 **You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.**
 **A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs**
 - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a valu
