### HTML Images
- Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.
- In HTML, images are defined with the <img> tag.

- The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

- The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:
- The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
    -The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:
- you can use the width and height attributes:
- Image Floating
    - Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:float:left;
    


**for example you should write <img src="url" alt="describe the imge" width="500" height="600">**

### Color

- we can use three ways to use the colors in CSS :

> rgb values for red, green and blue colors : rgb(200,150,90)

> hex codes by write six-digit such as:#800000	

> color names such as  write color:LightGray; to change the font color.

### Text
**TEXT FORMATTING This text is styled with some of the text formatting properties. The heading uses the text-align, text-transform, and color properties. The paragraph is indented, aligned, and the space between characters is specified. The underline is removed from this colored**

- The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

- The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

- The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.

- The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified.
    - When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight.
    
- The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text.
    - The value text-decoration: none; is often used to remove underlines from links:
- The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.
    - It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word
