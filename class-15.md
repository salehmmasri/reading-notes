# What Google Learned

- What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team :
- Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’

- ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’ Furthermore, psych safety consists of 2 traits (covered in this article):

- conversational turn taking (everyone in the group gets roughly around the same time to speak up)

- average social sensitivity (the individuals in a group have high average social sensitivity

- they can tell when someone in their group is feeling down or is upset).

- Project Aristotle started in 2012 in Google People Ops.

- Started looking into team composition (average IQ? Gender balance? Same hobbies/education background?). Found out that there were no patterns there.

- Started looking at group norms instead. Insight here: group norms determine how you act in a group and override individual properties + behaviours. Good group norms lead to better collective intelligence, regardless of whether the individuals of the group were brilliant or not.

- The norm that matters: conversational turn taking and average social sensitivity. Both make up psych safety.
